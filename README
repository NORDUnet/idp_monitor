IdPmonitor
==========

A script that verifies that your IdP is up and running.
To be able to really check this it has to do a complete authentication.
Presently only login with username and password is supported.

In order to be able to do the login without a user present some configuration
is needed.

interaction
...........

The really hard part is the **interaction** part. This is where the
the script is told how to fake that there is a human behind the keyboard.

It consists of a lists of dictionaries with the keys: **matches**,
**page-type** and **control**.

The idea is to use **matches** to **activated** a corresponding set of
**controls**.

matches
-------

**matches** is used to identify a page or a form within a page.
There are four different things that can be used to match the page:

* url : The action url
* title : The title of the page, substring matching is used.
* content: Something in the page, again substring matching is used, and finally

Normally the front-end will pick out the necessary information by
using a users interaction with the entity. If you are running this
directly from the prompt then you have to provide the information.
You can build this information by using the fact that the script will
dump any page it doesn't know what to do with.

An example::


    {
        "matches": {
            "url": "http://localhost:8088/login",
            "title": 'IDP test login'
        },
        "page-type": "login",
        "control": {
            "type": "form",
            "set": {"login": "roland", "password": "dianakra"}
        }
    }

The action here is to set the control *login* to 'roland' and the control
*password* to 'dianakra' and then post the form.

Or if the server uses HTTP Post binding::

    {
        "matches": {
            "url": "http://localhost:8088/sso/redirect",
            "title": "SAML 2.0 POST"
        },
        "control": {
            "type": "response",
            "pick": {"form": {"action":"http://localhost:8088/acs"}}
        }
    },

Here the action is just to post the form, no information is added to the form.

page-type
---------

**page-type** is used to mark the page as *login* or *user-consent*.
This is used in specific conversation where one or the other is expected
in certain circumstances.

control
-------

**control** specifies what the script should enter where and which button
to press.


installation
------------

Install pysaml2:
$ git clone https://github.com/rohe/pysaml2
$ cd pysaml2
$ python setup.py install
$ cd ..

Install xmlsec1, python-bs4 & python-mechanize
(On Ubuntu)
$ apt-get install libxmlsec1 python-bs4 python-mechanize

Fetch idp_monitor from github
$ git clone https://github.com/its-dirg/idp_monitor
$ cd idp_monitor

Edit the conf.py
Set BASE to 'https://<FQDN for tester host>:8087'.
Set PATH to script location, absolute path.
Set IDPBASE to the base URL of the IDP, ie. 'https://<FQDN of IDP>:443/idp'.
Modify the INTERACTION defenition, see above.

Create SP certificates
$ openssl req -new -sha1 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -subj "/CN=<FQDN of tester>/O=<Organisation>/C=<Country descriptor>" -keyout ./keys/server.pem -out ./keys/server.csr
$ openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in ./keys/server.csr -signkey ./keys/server.pem -out ./keys/server.crt

Create the metadata for the SP part
$ make_metadata.py conf > sp.xml

Grab the metadata from the IDP(s) and put it in the file 'idp.xml'

Run some tests
$ ./idp_monitor.py conf
NOTE: no ".py" at the end of the config file name.
If you have several entityIDs in the idp.xml file you have to specify which entityID to use.
$ ./idp_monitor.py -e <entityID> conf
